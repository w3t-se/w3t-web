We were able to attend the [EthCC[7]](https://ethcc.io/) this year! It was an exciting opportunity to connect with fellow enthusiasts, developers, and innovators who are shaping the future of decentralized technologies.

As Ethereum continues to evolve, conferences like EthCC provide invaluable insights into the latest advancements and projects. I was particularly interested in the discussions around ease of use and business Tokenization. If you were there give us a shout out at [X](https://x.com/w3t_se), I'd love to connect and share ideas!

We also had the chance to take part in a short interview with the fairly large Crypto newsletter [Milkroad](https://milkroad.com). They were mostly concerned with the ups and downs in the crypto markets it seemed. Ah, well, they probably have loads of interesting content but we're just too busy mashing keyboards...

We were also able to get into the *very* exclusive Proof-of-Data by [3Box Labs](https://3boxlabs.com/). Basically, they are trying to decentralize all of our Data with new a Data-layer (called Ceramic) for Web3 on top of [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/). We have used [ComposeDB](https://composedb.js.org/) (a GraphQL Database on top of Ceramic with Composable shareable Schema and Data) in our own Blockchain Endeavour [Codo](https://www.codo.community/).

Speaking of Codo, we actually finished a small demo version of the [Codo app](https://app.codo.community/). If you don't know what Codo is, it's our venture into Decentraland trying to build the [Gig-Economy](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGA0AWvJUs/Sf8jR833lo7V6Jxe7ROExA/view?utm_content=DAGA0AWvJUs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor) layer for Web3. We even handed out some cool flyers to some very enthusiastic and nice people! Stay tuned for an update on Codo, ComposeDB and more!

All in all a great visit! We were served some great Belgian beers and in general had a great time! See you next year (:blush:)!
