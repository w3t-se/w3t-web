## Tools
We implemented a suite of tools including Jenkins for continuous integration, Helm for package management, and Kubernetes for orchestration. This stack enabled automated deployments and streamlined the release process, reducing manual intervention and the potential for errors.

## Cross-Site Replication
To ensure high availability and disaster recovery, we set up cross-site replication. This involved synchronizing data across multiple data centers, providing resilience against site-specific failures and ensuring uninterrupted service delivery.

## Merger Considerations
During the project, the client was undergoing a merger with a parent company, adding complexity to the integration process. We navigated this by aligning our automation strategies with both organizations' workflows, facilitating a smoother transition and unifying development practices.
